# secret_password = "PythonRocks"
# user_guess = ""  # Define it first so the loop has a value to check

# while user_guess != secret_password:  # While it's incorrect, keep looping
#     user_guess = input("Enter the secret password: ")

#     if user_guess == secret_password:
#         print("🏆 The treasure chest opens!")
#     else:
#         print("🚪 Wrong password! Try again.")

# I asked chatGPT why couldn't we define "user_guess" as input BEFORE the loop. Here is what was returned:

# ✅ This also works, but it changes the behavior slightly:
# 1️⃣ The first input happens before the loop starts.
# 2️⃣ If the user enters the correct password on the first try, the loop never runs at all!
# 3️⃣ The "Wrong! Try again:" message only appears if they make a mistake.

# So Which One Is Better?
# 👉 If you want the loop to always run at least once, the first approach (defining user_guess = "" before the loop) is better.
# 👉 If you want to check before entering the loop, the second approach works fine.

# Neither is wrong, but the first version is more standard for user input loops because it ensures the loop always starts and keeps all input-handling inside the loop.


# secret_password = "PythonRocks"
# user_guess = input("Enter the secret password: ")  # Ask before the loop starts

# while user_guess != secret_password:
#     user_guess = input("👎🏾 Wrong! Try again: ")

# print("🏆 The treasure chest opens!")

# I indeed tested this out and everything still worked functionally the same. It was a pretty magical moment 
# that my brain was picking it up and thinking intuitively. Out of curiosity, I asked about the defaul case sensativity of inputs. Here is the interaction:

# Me: This is all so much fun! I don't want to get ahead of myself but are inputs always case sensitive? 
# Is there a way to make the input not be case sensitive? 

# ChatGPT said:
# June, I love how your brain is thinking ahead! 🚀 You’re asking exactly the kind of questions that will make you a great programmer.

# 🔠 Are Inputs Always Case-Sensitive in Python?
# Yes! By default, Python treats strings as case-sensitive

# 🛠️ How to Make Input Not Case-Sensitive
# If you want the input to be case-insensitive, you need to convert it to the same format before comparing. The two most common ways are:

# ✅ Convert Input to Lowercase (.lower())
# This ensures that "PythonRocks", "PYTHONROCKS", and "pythonrocks" all match.

# password = "pythonrocks"  # Store in lowercase
# user_input = input("Enter password: ").lower()  # Convert input to lowercase

# if user_input == password:
#     print("✅ Access Granted!")
# else:
#     print("❌ Wrong password!")

# 🔥 Bonus: .casefold() for Full Case Insensitivity
# For even better case-insensitive matching, use .casefold(). It works like .lower(), 
# but it's even better at handling special characters and different alphabets.

# 💡 Challenge: Modify Your Code!
# 1️⃣ Modify your treasure chest password program so that it’s case-insensitive.
# 2️⃣ Experiment with .lower(), .upper(), and .casefold()—see if you notice any differences!
# 3️⃣ Try entering the password in different ways (like PYTHONrocks, pythonROCKS, etc.) and see what happens!
